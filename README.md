# project-3
I used the job posting data set from kaggle.
I used plotly.com/python to create the choropleth map.
Other websites that were used to help create my code were https://geeksforgeeks.org/choropleth-maps-using-plotly-in-python/, https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp, and Xpert Learning Assistant for the bootcamp.
